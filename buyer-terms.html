    <h1>NexaChain Buyer — Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> NexaChain Buyer is a <strong>non-custodial</strong> crypto payment app. You are responsible for your wallet, keys, and transactions.
      Blockchain transactions are generally <strong>irreversible</strong>.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the NexaChain Buyer mobile application (“App”).
      By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree,
      do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) to use the App.
      By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement and are legally permitted to use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Non-Custodial Nature</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The App is <strong>non-custodial</strong>. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not hold, control, or manage your funds.</li>
        <li>We do not store or have access to your private keys, seed phrase, or recovery phrase.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and wallet credentials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you lose access to your wallet (e.g., lost device, forgotten credentials, lost seed phrase), we cannot
        recover your funds.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Payments &amp; Transactions</h2>
    <p>
      The App allows you to initiate blockchain transactions to pay merchants. You acknowledge and agree that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blockchain transactions may be <strong>irreversible</strong>.</li>
      <li>Network congestion, fees (“gas”), or third-party outages may delay transactions.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for verifying the merchant address, network, token, and amount before confirming.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee that a transaction will be completed successfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Fees</h2>
    <p>
      The App may display applicable network fees and may display platform/service fees if enabled in the App.
      Network fees are charged by the blockchain network and are not controlled by us. Any platform/service fee,
      if applicable, will be shown to you before you confirm a transaction.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Merchant Disputes, Refunds, and Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
      You understand that crypto payments may not support traditional chargebacks. Any disputes regarding goods
      or services must be resolved directly between you and the merchant. Refunds (if any) are handled by the merchant,
      and may be subject to the merchant’s policies and blockchain network conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any laws, regulations, or third-party rights.</li>
      <li>Engage in fraud, scams, or deceptive activities.</li>
      <li>Transmit malicious code, attempt unauthorized access, or disrupt the App’s operation.</li>
      <li>Use the App in a manner that could harm users, merchants, or the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. No Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not provide investment, legal, tax, or financial advice. Any information shown in the App is for
      general informational purposes only. You are solely responsible for your decisions and actions when using digital assets.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may rely on third-party services, networks, or APIs (including blockchain nodes and QR scanning libraries)
      to function. We are not responsible for third-party failures, downtime, errors, or losses caused by third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim
      all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, NexaChain Buyer and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect,
      incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or digital assets,
      arising from or related to your use of the App, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of access to wallet credentials or seed phrase</li>
      <li>Incorrect addresses, wrong networks, or incorrect token selection</li>

      liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation
      of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another party.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access to the App at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or if required
      by law. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your jurisdiction unless otherwise required by mandatory consumer protection laws.
